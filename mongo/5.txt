The collections "customer" and "product" is already correct (normalized-ish), but the collection "orders_w_lines" can be improved.

It can be separated to "order" and "basket."

"order" can contain only the order information and also have a basket reference.

"basket" can reference to the order and have a list of products.

It will be easier to query product-related information.
